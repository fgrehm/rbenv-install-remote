# rbenv-install-remote

rbenv-install-remote is a [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
and [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) plugin that hooks into
`rbenv install` command to download and install remote build definitions.

## Installation

First make sure you have an updated `ruby-build`, as you'll need the
[support for hooks](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/commit/cb2a79f1119daf6cbb030d76f66e9bd04581ccc2)
in place.

    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    $ git pull

Installing rbenv-install-remote as an rbenv plugin will allow you to use
`rbenv install` with remote build definitions.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/fgrehm/rbenv-install-remote.git

## Usage

As this plugin will only hook into `ruby-build` and download the custom definition
before building, please refer to [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
to find out its supported parameters. With `rbenv-install-remote` you'll be able
to:

    $ rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/my-ruby-version

And if everything goes fine, this will provide a `my-ruby-version` for use
with rbenv.

You can also specify a version name if the url isn't enough:

    $ RUBY_NAME=my-ruby-version rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/some-crazy-url.sh

If you wanna know more about custom definitions, see the [ruby-build built-in
definitions](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/tree/master/share/ruby-build)
as a starting point for definition files.

### Known definitions

These 2 definitions will allow you to install REE on Ubuntu 12.04 with the patch
that will enable tcmalloc support so that you won't have to use
`CONFIGURE_OPTS="--no-tcmalloc"` when running `rbenv install`.

```terminal
$ rbenv install https://gist.github.com/fgrehm/3345650/raw/22e1b76faf6ea63c8083deba224bae5fb168b020/ree-1.8.7-2011.03
$ rbenv install https://gist.github.com/fgrehm/3345650/raw/d0d30531ff380135d6a0154efb7f4f10cd2cc6ca/ree-1.8.7-2012.02
```

This one is a patched `1.9.3-p194` for 30% faster Rails boot. See
https://gist.github.com/1688857 for more information.

```terminal
$ RUBY_NAME=1.9.3-p194-patched rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/1688857/2-1.9.3-p194-patched.sh
```

There is also an [updated version](https://gist.github.com/2593385) of the patch
that applies to `1.9.3-p286` as well.

```terminal
$ rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/7f4e8a98c16e9f67ecba/1.9.3-p194-falcon
$ rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/7f4e8a98c16e9f67ecba/1.9.3-p286-falcon
```

For [`1.9.3-p327`](https://gist.github.com/1688857):

```terminal
$ RUBY_NAME=1.9.3-p327-patched rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/1688857/2-1.9.3-p327-patched.sh
```
